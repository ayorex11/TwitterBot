This is a twitter Bot that allows automation of tasks like login and create post currently.
when other features are added it would be included.
first thing to do is to install python (if it's currently not on your laptop)
second thing is to install the gecko driver. It can be found on github.com/mozilla/geckodriver. Install the version compatible with your PC.
third thing is to unzip the geckodriver and then move it to your python folder i.e OS/Users/name of user/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310 then copy the geckodriver apk and paste into python310 folder.
After that install selenium(pip install selenium) and also firefox if not on PC.
